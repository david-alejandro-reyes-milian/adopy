# Adopy

![Workflow result](https://github.com/david-alejandro-reyes-milian/adopy/workflows/Check/badge.svg)

## :scroll: Description
Adopy is a prototype for a Puppy Adoption service. Shows a list of random puppies and the
details of your possible best friend :)


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
Main motivation is to explore current performance and usability of Jetpack Compose as a
replacement for the current Android UI development tools, also as a comparison with
Flutter in terms of performance and ease of expression for designing great UXs.

The project uses the main structure from several Compose example projects and will eventually
include full UncleBob clean arch.
